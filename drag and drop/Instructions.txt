To run and test the solution, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder on your computer to store the project files.

2. Open a text editor like Notepad or Visual Studio Code.

3. Copy the HTML code provided and paste it into a new file in the text editor.

4. Save the file with a ".html" extension, for example, "index.html".

5. Create another file in the same folder and name it "styles.css".

6. Copy the CSS code provided and paste it into the "styles.css" file.

7. Save the "styles.css" file.

8. Create a third file in the folder and name it "script.js".

9. Copy the JavaScript code provided and paste it into the "script.js" file.

10. Save the "script.js" file.

11. Now, you should have three files in the folder: "index.html", "styles.css", and "script.js".

12. Open the "index.html" file using a web browser like Chrome or Firefox.

13. The web page should open, and you will see two containers, items in the first container, and a "Reset" button.

14. To test the drag-and-drop functionality, try dragging an item from the first container and dropping it into the second container. You should see the item being moved successfully.

15. If you want to reset the containers, click on the "Reset" button. The containers will be cleared, and the items will be back in the first container.

16. You can repeat the dragging and dropping process to further test the functionality.

Follow these steps to run and test the solution, and observe how the drag-and-drop feature works on the web page.
